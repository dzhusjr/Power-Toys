To automate usage, install AutoHotkey software [https://www.autohotkey.com/] and run the .ahk file (might as well add to start-up for convenience. To do that, press Win + R -> type shell:startup -> press enter -> drop the .ahk file into the folder)
The .ahk file is in the repo. To run the script, press End (can be modified in .ahk file)
